# Software Tech Test 👨🏼‍💻

🎯 **The purpose of this repository is to archive my code developed for a technical test.**

## The proposed problem

BeverageServer is an automated beverage serving system. This way, as soon as the sale is completed, a command is sent to BeverageServer which will prepare the drink according to some rules:

- BeverageServer has 4 drink flavors, 2 soft drinks (Coke and Guarana) and 2 juices (Grape and Orange)
- Soft drinks are served in paper cups while juices are served in plastic cups
- Soft drinks receive 6 ice cubes while juices receive 12 ice cubes. There is also the option to serve without ice
- Soft drinks have 3 sizes available (300ml, 500ml and 700ml) while juices only have 2 options (300ml and 500ml)
- At the end, "Take Out" (Delivery) orders receive a lid without a hole, while "Eat In" orders (eat in the restaurant) receive a lid with a hole for the straw
 
According to the details above, you have 3 options:

1. [x] Create the pseudocode for this equipment
2. [x] Write the document with the requirements for this equipment
3. [x] Write test cases so that QA can test the equipment

✅ *All options were made successfully!*

<hr>

You can find inside the folder called ```Pseudocode``` all the logic I wanted to implement. Inside ```src``` folder you can find the main folder (with all Java code) and the tests folder (with all the tests).

⭐ I would like to highlight all the tests developed with JUnit5 to guarantee a stable system and prevent errors. Also making it easier for QA to test and find any type of instability or something related.

Thank you for reading!
